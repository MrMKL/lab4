```
Output :
1 8
4 8
4 8
8 8

From the output,we can see our computer uses 1 byte to save a character, 4 bytes to save both integer and floating number, and 8 bytes to save double floating number. And also we can see pointer always has a fixed size ( 8 bytes in 64-bit OS ), it's because pointer is a type to point to different type of number, it's just a address.
